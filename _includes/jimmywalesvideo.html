	<strong>Hi, I'm Jimmy Wales.</strong> If you've heard of me at all it's probably because you've heard
	of Wikipedia, which I set up. What you probably don't know about me is that
	<strong>I've set up a new foundation called the Jimmy Wales Foundation</strong> for freedom of
	expression. What we're mainly focused on is cases where people are being
	oppressed for perfectly peaceful speech online: bloggers, people who are using Twitter
	or Facebook in different places around the world, who have run into legal trouble
	for doing things that are absolutely not controversial. There's a lot of this
	going on in the world. <strong>The current case that I'm really, really campaigning for is
	the case of Bassel</strong> [Khartabil]. He was a Wikipedia volunteer who had done some fantastic work on 3d
	modeling of Palmyra, who was arrested and arbitrarily detained. It's a huge deal; go out
	and find out about it, but get involved in all of these cases. If you know of
	a case in your country of someone who's being oppressed, please do get
	in touch with us.
