He was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> lead in Syria and started a hackerspace, Aiki Lab, in Damascus in 2010 in addition to working on numerous other open source and free culture projects.</p>
                                      <p>Sunday, March 15 marks the third anniversary of his arrest, as well as the fourth anniversary of the Syrian uprising. In support of Bassel, Syria, and in efforts to raise awareness of both, #FreeBassel day events are being held around the world to mark this date.</p>
                                      <p>Here in SF, #FreeBassel supporters, artists, and members of the open community are gathering at the Electronic Frontier Foundation for a community-building event organized around a Wikipedia edit-a-thon in Bassel's honor. We'll be working to improve and add articles and media content related to Bassel and articles of interest to him. We’ll also be discussing his case and brainstorming about new projects and ideas to help bring awareness to his case.</p>
                                      <p>No prior Wikipedia editing experience is necessary, we’ll have experienced editors present to help you get set up and make your first edit. Artists and activists interested in freedom of expression are encouraged to come contribute to the discussion. Experienced Wikipedians also welcome to come learn more about Bassel, contribute to Wikipedia, and help others to become involved.</p>
