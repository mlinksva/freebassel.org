<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Khartabil"><strong>Bassel Khartabil aka Safadi,</strong></a> my dear friend from the old days in Damascus and lead of the <strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/cc-syria">Creative Commons community in Syria,</a></strong> has been living in a Syrian jail for almost 4 years now. He was arrested in March 2012 without a formal accusation or the right to see a lawyer.</p>
<p>Today we hear from his wife and dear friend <em>Noura Ghazi</em> that Bassel has been moved to an unknown location, probably to be judged by a military court. We do not have any more detail but we really fear for his life.</p>
<p>The more attention we can get on his case on the web, on mainstream media, the better to protect him from any abuse from the regime and secret services side.</p>
<p>Please help us spread awareness, please help us <em>#freebassel</em></p>
