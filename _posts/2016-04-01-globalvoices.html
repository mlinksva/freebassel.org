<p>Long before ISIS had seized the city and war had broken out in Syria, putting&nbsp;heritage sites at accelerated risk, one initiative was working to document Palmyra's archaeological wonders. The <a href="http://www.newpalmyra.org/" target="_blank">#NewPalmyra</a>&nbsp;project, which began in some form&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-palmyra-project-bassel-khartabil_us_5694175de4b0c8beacf80a9a" target="_blank">in 2005</a>, is the brainchild of&nbsp;Bassel Khartabil, a&nbsp;Palestinian-Syrian computer engineer,&nbsp;activist&nbsp;and&nbsp;Creative Commons leader.&nbsp;Khartabil <a href="https://archive.org/details/freebassel-palmyra">aimed&nbsp;to reconstruct</a> the city's history in a free online database of 3D models.</p>

<p>However, he&nbsp;was arrested by the Syrian government&nbsp;on March 15, 2012. After four years in detention, he was moved to an unknown location.&nbsp;Human Rights Watch and 30 other human rights organizations <a href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2015/10/05/fears-for-imprisoned-syrian-bassel-khartabil-transferred-to-an-unknown-location/">have&nbsp;demanded</a>&nbsp;that Khartabil's whereabouts be disclosed, but so far he <a href="https://globalvoices.org/2016/03/15/whereisbassel-imprisoned-syrian-technologist-is-still-missing/">remains missing</a>.</p>

<p>In October, a group of activists revived&nbsp;Khartabil's effort, naming it&nbsp;#NewPalmyra. They crowdsource photos and rely on volunteers to help construct 3D models of Palmyra's historic gems.</p>
