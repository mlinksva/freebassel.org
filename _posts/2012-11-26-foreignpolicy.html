<p>19 RIMA DALI, BASSEL KHARTABIL</p>
<p>For insisting, against all odds, on a peaceful Syrian revolution.</p>
<p>Activists | Syria

<p>With Syria mired in sectarian mayhem, a few brave souls still stand as a
testament to the possibilities -- and the extraordinary costs -- of nonviolent
revolution. When dictator Bashar al-Assad<i>'</i>s artillery laid waste to entire
neighborhoods this spring, Rima Dali, a volunteer for the Syrian Arab Red
Crescent, strode alone into a busy Damascus street with a sign bearing a <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/04/09/syria-activist-rima-dali-arrested-in-damascus-for-calling-for-end-to-killing/" target="_blank">simple message</a>: <i>"</i>Stop the killing. We want to build a country
for all Syrians." She repeated her act of <a href="http://youtu.be/rHL1lBEKXew" target="_blank">silent defiance</a> the next
week, and even more onlookers gathered to cheer her on -- a sign that
the spirit of peaceful protest that sparked Syria's uprising in early 2011
endures even after a bloody year and a half of civil war. Dali, a 33-year-old
law school graduate, was arrested for her activism, but she has refused to be
cowed, either by the Assad regime's intimidation or by the spread of extremism
within the ranks of the armed rebellion. "We look for hope, day in, day out,"
she <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18091103" target="_blank">said</a> after her release from jail.

Not all those who have publicly defied Assad have been so
fortunate. Bassel Khartabil is, or was, a young computer engineer living in
Damascus whose innovative programming skills helped integrate Syria into the
online community -- fostering an open-source community in a country long on the margins of the Internetâ€™s youth culture. He was hauled off<b> </b>by Assad's security forces in March, and despite a "<a href="http://freebassel.org/" target="_blank">#FREEBASSEL</a>" campaign launched by his friends, he has not been heard from
since. "The people who are in real danger never leave their countries," he tweeted
weeks before his arrest. "They are in danger for a reason and for that they
don't leave."
