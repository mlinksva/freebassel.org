<p>Bassel Khartabil is a Syrian Wikipedian and a passionate advocate for free knowledge. In 2012, he was detained in Damascus. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has determined Bassel's detention is a violation of human rights and called on the Syrian government to release him. We heard from his family this morning that Bassel was moved from Adra Prison in Damascus to an unknown location. As a member of our global community, we are concerned about Bassel's safety and wish to see him free again soon.</p>
