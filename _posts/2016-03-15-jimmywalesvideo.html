<strong>Hi, everybody, Jimmy Wales here. Today is March 15th.</strong> This is
  an important anniversary for two reasons. For the world, this is the fifth
  anniversary of the beginnings of the Syrian conflict. For me personally, and a
  lot of the other people who are in the Wikipedia movement, the open source
  movement, <strong>it's the fourth anniversary of Bassel's detainment in
  Syria</strong>. Four days from now we're going to be holding protests in many
  different cities around the world. You can see the list here on the
  website. The real question we're trying to put out to the world, the message
  that we want you to carry to your friends, to your family, to the media
  everywhere is: <strong>"Where is Bassel? We need to know what is going on with
  Bassel."</strong>
<br/>

	<strong>Hi, I'm Jimmy Wales.</strong> If you've heard of me at all it's probably because you've heard
	of Wikipedia, which I set up. What you probably don't know about me is that
	<strong>I've set up a new foundation called the Jimmy Wales Foundation</strong> for freedom of
	expression. What we're mainly focused on is cases where people are being
	oppressed for perfectly peaceful speech online: bloggers, people who are using Twitter
	or Facebook in different places around the world, who have run into legal trouble
	for doing things that are absolutely not controversial. There's a lot of this
	going on in the world. <strong>The current case that I'm really, really campaigning for is
	the case of Bassel</strong> [Khartabil]. He was a Wikipedia volunteer who had done some fantastic work on 3d
	modeling of Palmyra, who was arrested and arbitrarily detained. It's a huge deal; go out
	and find out about it, but get involved in all of these cases. If you know of
	a case in your country of someone who's being oppressed, please do get
	in touch with us.
