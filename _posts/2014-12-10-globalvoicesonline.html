<p>Today, on Human Rights Day, we remind the world of our many friends who have broken the silence of oppression by expressing their thoughts, asking questions, and thinking critically and constructively about how to solve the problems before them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We remember today <a class="vt-p" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaa_Abd_El-Fattah">Alaa Abd El Fattah</a> and <a class="vt-p" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Khartabil">Bassel Khartabil</a> (aka Bassel Safadi), two jailed friends who are serving arbitrary sentences that will jeopardize their futures as innovative and free thinkers from the Arab region. Bassel has been behind bars in Syria since March 2011, and Alaa has been imprisoned in Egypt repeatedly since the era of Mubarak.</p>
<p>Break the silence with us today in this global campaign for Alaa, Bassel, and the many others who have been unjustly imprisoned because of their activism.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>About Alaa</h3>
<p>Alaa Abd El Fattah is an Egyptian political activist, blogger, and open source advocate who has spent the better part of the past three years in prison. First jailed in 2006 under Mubarak, Alaa has been in and out of prison since 2011 for false accusations made in connection with his longstanding and influential activism. In December 2011, he missed the birth of his son Khaled, while in <a class="vt-p" href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/11/13/egypt-plight-of-bloggers-continues-at-military-courts/">detention</a>.</p>
<p>In June 2014, he was <a class="vt-p" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/alaa-abd-el-fattah-sentenced-absentia-15-years-jail">sentenced</a> in absentia—despite being just outside the courtroom—to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>Though he was <a class="vt-p" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/good-news-alaa-abd-el-fattah-freed-bail">released</a>&nbsp;on bail for a brief period in September, Alaa was <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/world/middleeast/alaa-abd-el-fattah-dissident-blogger-is-re-arrested-in-egypt.html">arrested</a> again on October 21. On November 18, he spent yet another birthday, his 33rd, in Cairo’s Torah Prison. He is allowed out of his cell only for one hour a day, and is not regularly allowed outdoors. As of December 10, he will have been on hunger strike for 38 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alaa’s sister, Sanaa Seif, was <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/gavon/editor-of-oscar-nominated-documentary-the-square-sentenced-t">sentenced</a> to three years in prison in October for violating Egypt’s draconian protest law.&nbsp;</p>
