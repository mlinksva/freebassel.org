<strong>U.N. Working Group calls for release of Syrian Web developer</strong><br>

The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx">United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a>&nbsp;issued a position on the situation of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Khartabil">Bassel Khartabil (aka Safadi)</a>, a Web developer and transparency advocate who worked with Creative Commons, Mozilla, and other open-Web organizations. Khartabil has been jailed in Syria since March 2012. The working group considers his detention <em>"</em>arbitrary" and has called for his immediate release.
