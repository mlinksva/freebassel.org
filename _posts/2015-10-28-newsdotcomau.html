<p><strong>WHEN Islamic State is not destroying lives, it is destroying ancient ruins.</strong></p></div><p>The latest act of senseless destruction took place on Monday in a city that once attracted hundreds of thousands of tourists each year.</p><p>AFP reports three columns in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra were blown up while three people were tied to them. It was a sickening act designed to show the world Islamic State&#x2019;s disregard for life or history.</p><p>Across the Middle East, in Syria and in Iraq, ancient ruins continue to fall. <a href="http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/islamic-state-releases-photos-showing-destruction-of-2000-year-old-palmyra-temple/story-fnh81ifq-1227498888649">A 2000-year-old temple was blown up</a> in August. Before that Islamic State militants <a href="http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/islamic-state-militants-destroy-ancient-artefacts-in-iraq-museum/story-fnh81ifq-1227240826185">destroyed statues, including a 9th Century BC Assyrian winged bull</a> at a museum in Mosul.</p><p>IS&#x2019;s weapons are intimidation and brute force, but archaeologists are fighting back. Armed with 3D cameras and technology that makes it possible to &#x201C;rebuild&#x201D; lost artefacts, they hope to rescue an important part of history, even if they can&#x2019;t physically stop it being blown to pieces.</p><div class="module image-module module-image-650w488h"><div class="module-content"><div class="image-block image-650w488h"><div class="image-frame"><img alt="The beautiful, ancient city of Palmyra fell to IS in May." src="http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b5dda366677bea4c4250dcc37ca9989c" width="650" height="488"></div><p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The beautiful, ancient city of Palmyra fell to IS in May.</span><span class="image-source"><em>Source:</em>AP</span></p></div></div></div><p><b>A TWISTED MOTIVATION</b></p><p>Palmyra&#x2019;s ruins are on the UNESCO World Heritage List, alongside natural wonders like our own Great Barrier Reef and architectural marvels like the Great Wall of China, the pyramids at Giza and the Acropolis in Athens.</p><p>The site was popular with visitors from around the world but its prominence also made it the perfect target for Islamic State.</p><p><i>The New York Times</i> published <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/29/world/middleeast/isis-historic-sites-control.html">The Strategy Behind Islamic State&#x2019;s Destruction of Ancient Sites</a></i> earlier this year.

These days, he is behind bars, a prisoner of the Assad regime, unable to offer any assistance.</p><p>In his absence, friends and complete strangers have taken up the challenge. <i><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/jailed-activist-bassel-khartabil-3d-models-could-save-syrian-history-from-isis/#slide-4">Wired</a></i><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/jailed-activist-bassel-khartabil-3d-models-could-save-syrian-history-from-isis/#slide-4"> reports they&#x2019;ve established the New Palmyra Project</a>, an online collection of 3D models of the 1st century AD city using photographs taken by Mr Khartabil.</p><p>The political prisoner was jailed for fighting for the free access to the internet. <a href="http://freebassel.org/">There&#x2019;s a website dedicated to seeking his release</a>. While they wait, his colleagues are getting in on with the project. This week they released the first batch of files.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a timely release given the real Palmyra is falling to the ground. Islamic State has seized full control of the region and Syrian state forces withdrew in May.</p><p>For now, IS has the perfect backdrop for its propaganda and the world is watching in horror.</p>
