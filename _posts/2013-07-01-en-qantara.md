Bassel Khartabil was not able to leave the country in time. According to reports by the human rights organization Amnesty International, security agents arrested the activist and software developer in March 2012, handing him over later to a military court. Information on his whereabouts has come to light – via other detainees, for example – but his family has been denied any contact.

Bassel, who is in his early 30s, says if it wasn't for his online supporters, he would have slipped into anonymity. On the first anniversary of his arrest on 15 March, online activists around the world declared "Free Bassel Day". They had already launched an online campaign under the same motto. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are also aware of the Khartabil case and are calling for his release.

The "Gulf Center for Human Rights" writes: "The arrest of Bassel Khartabil and his continuing detention are directly connected with his campaign for freedom of speech and information." Khartabil had been specializing in the development of free software. He is alleged to have been involved in developing programmes such as Mozilla Firefox; the Free Bassel campaign website also claims he worked on the online lexicon Wikipedia.
