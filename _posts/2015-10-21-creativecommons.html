<p>Today marks the launch of <a href="http://www.newpalmyra.org/">#NEWPALMYRA</a>, an online community platform and data repository dedicated to the capture, preservation, sharing, and creative reuse of data about the ancient city of Palmyra. The project features 3-D models of ruins from Palmyra created&nbsp;by Bassel Khartabil, the lead for Creative Commons Syria who has been imprisoned there since March 2012.</p>

<p>In today’s WIRED article&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/jailed-activist-bassel-khartabil-3d-models-could-save-syrian-history-from-isis/">A Jailed Activist’s 3-D Models Could Save Syria’s History From ISIS</a>,&nbsp;</em>Andy Greenberg highlights the project’s dual purpose:</p>

<blockquote><p>The New Palmyra Project seeks to digitally rebuild those structures as they’re being physically deleted—and in doing so, put a spotlight on the project’s creator that could help pressure the Assad regime to release him.</p></blockquote>

<p>#NEWPALMYRA says that it will “work &nbsp;to source archeological and historical data, share it with the community, and output art exhibitions, salons, and creative works using this data to carry the rich history of Palmyra forward to new generations.”</p>

<p>All data collected by the project will&nbsp;be released into the public domain using the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a> at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newpalmyra.org/">newpalmyra.org</a>.</p>

<p>“Bassel’s contributions to Creative Commons have always inspired collaboration, community, and the sharing of culture and knowledge,” said Ryan Merkley, CEO of Creative Commons. “We’re proud to see these historical monuments preserved and protected digitally and shared freely with the world. Because of his leadership, #NEWPALMYRA&nbsp;will live on for everyone as part of the Commons.”</p>
