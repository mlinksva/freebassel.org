Also in attendance were representatives of the campaign to free Bassel Khartabil, a Palestinian-Syrian software developer and open source activist. Khartabil cared dearly for Palmyra and wanted to help people enjoy Syria's rich history. He had spearheaded a plan to build 3-D models of the city to be posted online for anyone to see as part of the New Palmyra project.

But he isn't able to see the replica of the Arch de Triumph. Khartabil had been held in a Syrian prison since 2012. In October 2015 , he was taken out of his cell by military police, and his family does not know what happened to him. The campaign to free Khartabil hopes that his work on Palmyra could trigger a presidential pardon.
