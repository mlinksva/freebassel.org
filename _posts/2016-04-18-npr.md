The dust had hardly settled in recaptured Palmyra, liberated from ISIS last month, when new debates began: How much should the ruins be restored, and by whom? Archaeologists raged against Michel's plan to install his 20-foot-scale model of the Arch of Triumph in the wreckage of Palmyra within six months, arguing that a re-created arch would alter the historical meaning of the ancient site.

But there is no debate about Palmyra's importance in the public imagination.

"This is the silver lining," says Barry Threw, director of the New Palmyra Project. "It takes someone to go in and blow it up for people to care. Anything that keeps attention on this space, I'm fine with. At least it's keeping this alive in a different way."

Threw works with activists and archaeologists to preserve Palmyra's culture digitally. In collaboration with MIT, the New Palmyra group has launched an online collection of images of 3-D models of the city, building on the work of Bassel Khartabil, a Syrian software developer and advocate for open-source technology.

Khartabil created some of the first 3-D renderings of ancient Palmyra. He was arrested by the Syrian regime in 2011 and disappeared in Syria's vast prison system.
