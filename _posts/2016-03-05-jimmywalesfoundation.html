<p><strong>Bassel Khartabil</strong>&nbsp;has been imprisoned in Syria since&nbsp;March 15, 2012. Bassel is a Palestinian Syrian&nbsp;national whom his love to technology might have got&nbsp;him into trouble in Syria as the revolution of 2011 has taken&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>Bassel, the lead of Creative Commons&nbsp;Syria, had been detained in an&nbsp;undisclosed location for 9 months&nbsp;until he&nbsp;was transferred&nbsp;to Adra prison, where he finally gained access to see&nbsp;his family and wife on a weekly basis.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>#WhereIsBassel?</strong></span></h3>
<p>On October 3, 2015, Bassel disappeared. Reports claimed that his&nbsp;name was stricken off the&nbsp;prison register and he was taken away by security&nbsp;forces from his cell to an unknown location. Bassel’s&nbsp;whereabouts is a mystery ever since.</p>
<p>Foreign Policy magazine named Bassel one of its <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/11/26/the-fp-top-100-global-thinkers/" target="_blank">Top&nbsp;100 Global Thinkers</a>&nbsp;of 2012, “for insisting, against all&nbsp;odds, on a peaceful Syrian revolution”.&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2013, Index on&nbsp;Censorship <a href="https://blog.creativecommons.org/2013/03/21/imprisoned-internet-pioneer-bassel-khartabil-wins-index-on-censorship-digital-freedom-award/" target="_blank">awarded</a>&nbsp;Bassel the 2013&nbsp;Digital Freedom Award for his work using&nbsp;technology to promote an open and free Internet.&nbsp;Following his disappearance, the MIT&nbsp;Media Lab offered Bassel a&nbsp;research scientist position in the Media Lab’s Center&nbsp;for Civic Media.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons Board of Directors <a href="https://blog.creativecommons.org/2015/10/17/creative-commons-board-of-directors-consensus-resolution-for-bassel-safadi-release/" target="_blank">called</a> for&nbsp;Bassel’s immediate and safe release in a resolution at&nbsp;its most recent meeting. In November 2015, Bassel was offered by the board a position as a&nbsp;Digital Cultural Preservation Fellow.&nbsp;His numerous&nbsp;and impactful contributions to the open web and the&nbsp;commons has always inspired collaboration,&nbsp;community and the sharing of culture and knowledge.&nbsp;As a Creative Commons Fellow, Bassel can continue&nbsp;the important work he started years ago.</p>
<p>Bassel, an&nbsp;open source software developer, has been a key contributor to projects that&nbsp;digitize, preserve, and share cultural heritage works.&nbsp;The <a href="http://newpalmyra.org" target="_blank">#NEWPALMYRA</a> project, co-founded by Bassel, is an online community platform and&nbsp;data repository dedicated to the capture, preservation,&nbsp;sharing and creative reuse of data about the ancient&nbsp;city of Palmyra. It features 3-D models of&nbsp;ruins from Palmyra.&nbsp;Bassel’s life project continues to&nbsp;develop these days by his friends, who are hoping and waiting for&nbsp;his safe&nbsp;return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">The Jimmy Wales Foundation&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Internet community&nbsp;call&nbsp;the governments&nbsp;of the world to reach out to the Syrian authorities&nbsp;immediately and urge them to reveal Bassel’s&nbsp;condition and location to his family and legal&nbsp;representatives. We call the Syrian authorities to exercise clemency in his&nbsp;case.</h3>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Bring Bassel home.</h2>
