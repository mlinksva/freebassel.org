London — Sunday, 22 May 2016 — The #FREEBASSEL Campaign launched three initiatives, including #happybdaybassel social media campaign, The Cost of Freedom Book, and "Waiting..." A Prose Book, to celebrate the 35th birthday of loved Syrian technology innovator, Bassel Khartabil.

\#FREEBASSEL Campaign Leader, Dana Trometer said, "Sunday, May 22 is Bassel's 35th Birthday. He has been jailed for more than four years without any official legal proceedings or process, and disappeared now for more than six months in Damascus, Syria. Today, do something
creative and post to twitter and facebook with: #happybdaybassel tag for Bassel."

The campaign also is launching two books online for download, and in print on demand. The first book is
*Cost of Freedom: A Collective Inquiry*, a book demanding freedom for Bassel Khartabil and an introspection on the costs of participation in free knowledge movements. The book was written in Pourrières, France from November 2nd to 6th, 2015, with contributions from 45 free knowledge activists around the world, including Creative Commons founder and former U.S. presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig and Khartabil's spouse, Noura Ghazi Safadi, and uncle, Faraj Rifait.

"Four years is a long time for a computer guy to not use a computer," said Mike Linksvayer, notable Free Culture activist. "Bassel could have written several books by now, thousands of lines of software code to help humanity, rebuilt Palmyra, and joined us in Aix En Provence or online if he was free to write this book. So we wrote and edited this collection to take up a cause he worked tirelessly on, FREE CULTURE."

In addition, *Waiting..." A Prose Book* by Noura Ghazi Safadi, Bassel's wife, also is available in an updated format, ready for printing with improved format, language improvements, and special print on demand features.

"Waiting... is an important poetry work which combines both the original Arabic poems written by Noura Ghazi Safadi, which Bassel translated while in jail, and we formatted into this new print edition," stated Christopher Adams, editor and publisher of the book.

Both books are available in electronic and print formats for reading, downloading, sharing, and purchase at <http://costoffreedom.cc> and <http://waiting4bassel.cc>. Both are dedicated to the public domain with the "CC Zero" license (CC0-1.0).
