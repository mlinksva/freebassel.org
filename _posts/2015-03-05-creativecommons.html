<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Khartabil">Bassel Khartabil</a>&nbsp;(also known as Bassel Safadi) is a computer engineer who, through his innovations in social media, digital education, and open-source web software, played a huge role in opening the Internet in Syria and bringing online access and knowledge to the Syrian people. Many people reading this blog know Bassel through his work as lead for CC Syria.</p>
<p>Sunday, March 15, 2015 marks the third anniversary of Bassel’s&nbsp;arrest and imprisonment in Syria, as well as the fourth anniversary of the Syrian uprising.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, <a href="http://freebassel.org/">#FreeBassel</a> supporters, artists, and members of the open community are gathering at the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> for a community-building event organized around a Wikipedia edit-a-thon in Bassel’s honor. We’ll be working to improve and add articles and media content related to Bassel and articles of interest to him. We’ll also be discussing his case and brainstorming about new projects and ideas to help bring awareness to his case. Here are the details:</p>
<p><strong>March 15, 2015 </strong><br>
