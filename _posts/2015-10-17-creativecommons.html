<h1>Creative Commons Board of Directors approves resolution calling for Bassel Safadi&nbsp;release</h1>
<h4>Timothy Vollmer, October 17th, 2015</h4>
</div>
<p>At its meeting on October 16, 2015, the Creative Commons Board of Directors unanimously approved the following motion:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Consensus Resolution re: Bassel Safadi</strong><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p dir="ltr">WHEREAS: Creative Commons is hosting its bi-annual Global Summit in Seoul, South Korea from Oct 15-<span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1750153354"><span class="aQJ">17, 2015</span></span>, an event that has previously been attended by Bassel Safadi (Khartabil), where he was an active and valued contributor, and where he is today profoundly missed by his friends and colleagues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">WHEREAS: Mr. Safadi has served faithfully and diligently as the Public Lead of CC Syria since 2009, and among other immeasurable contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Built Aiki Lab Community Center in Damascus that has hosted talks from key figures in the open web movement in support of Creative Commons communities in the Arab region;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Volunteered on countless free culture projects including Creative Commons, Mozilla, Wikipedia, and Openclipart;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Participated in and was a leader of several Creative Commons Arab Regional Meetings, including work to forge a unified Arabic translation of important CC licensing and public domain concepts;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Was named in 2012 as a one of the Top Global Thinkers by Foreign Policy for insisting on a peaceful Syrian revolution; and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Was awarded by Index on Censorship the Digital Freedom Award in 2013.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WHEREAS: Mr. Safadi’s contributions to Creative Commons have always inspired collaboration, community, and the sharing of culture and knowledge, including his leadership in the development of the #NewPalmyra, and his activism and involvement in the CC community and open internet community is deeply missed since his arrest and imprisonment without trial or assistance of counsel in March 2012.</p>
<p dir="ltr">NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED: that the Board of Directors hereby calls on Mr. Safadi’s captors for his immediate and safe release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
