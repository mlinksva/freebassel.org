> Another online community is #NEWPALMYRA, whose founder, a Syrian
> software developer named Bassel Khartabil, began photographing the
> ruins of the city in 2005 to capture its topography for computer
> renderings that portrayed it as it might have looked millennia
> ago. The group became an e-hub for the exploration of ancient
> Palmyran culture, with original writings, art shows, music and live
> workshops. An outspoken advocate for the free flow of information,
> Khartabil was arrested by the Syrian regime in 2012, and his current
> whereabouts are unknown. In his absence, #NEWPALMYRA has continued
> to build and refine its computer images and has begun to release 3-D
> printing specifications for models of wrecked monuments. This
> project, says the group’s interim director, Barry Threw, is “about
> getting people involved to contribute things creatively. And I think
> it’s more about the involvement and the actual creative act itself
> than it is necessarily about what the end products are.”
