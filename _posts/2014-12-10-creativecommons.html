<p>As of today, Creative Commons Syria lead Bassel Khartabil has been in prison for 1000 days. Today, we take a moment to honor Bassel and his contributions to Creative Commons. <a href="http://freebassel.org/">And we stand with our peers in the free software and free culture communities in demanding that he be freed</a>.</p>
<p>Before Bassel was imprisoned, he worked hard to build digital literacy in Syria. Not only did he play a central role in Syria’s CC community; he was also active in Wikimedia, Openclipart, and numerous other free culture projects. <a href="http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324669104578204300433143478">As Lawrence Lessig wrote</a>, “Mr. Khartabil isn’t a partisan, aligned with one Syrian faction against another. He represents a future, aligned against a totalitarian past.”</p>
<p>Bassel’s imprisonment is also a reminder that our fight is real. For those of us that work in relative safety, it can sometimes be easy to forget that a free and open internet is not a theoretical matter. Real lives are at risk.</p>
