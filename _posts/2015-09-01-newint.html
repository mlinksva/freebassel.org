<blockquote>
Assad's assault on this fledgling civil society is perhaps the saddest chapter in the tragedy of Syria's war. In rebel-held towns, schools and hospitals were hit by a rain of barrel bombs that killed thousands of civilians and displaced millions more. (See 'Rushing towards death' for the civilian humanitarian response). In areas under regime control, security services detained anyone who showed too much independence of mind â€“ web developers like Basel Khartabil, who campaigned for the freedom of information online; lawyers like Khalil Ma'touk, who defended Syria's prisoners of conscience; humanitarians like Raed al-Tawil, who volunteered with the Red Crescent in Damascus. All three men vanished into the regime's jails in 2012. Though al-Tawil was later released, Ma'touk and Khartabil have not been heard from since.
