Amid the destruction and atrocities tearing Syria apart, the ordeal of one young software developer tells its own story of a broken nation.

Bassel Khartabil, a Syrian-Palestinian technology innovator, had two main passions in life: opening up the internet and marrying Noura Ghazi, the love of his life. As an open-source software developer, he has contributed greatly to Wikipedia, Creative Commons, Mozilla Firefox, Openclipart and more. Taking advantage of his skills as a computer engineer, he promoted online access to knowledge in Syria through his AikiLab, based in Damascus.

His most recent project was a 3D-photo reconstruction of the ancient city of Palmyra (Tadmor), once known for its outstanding monuments. Khartabil used satellite photographs and real visits to the site to re-create a real-time visualisation of the old city, recently taken and vandalised by Isis.

On 15 March 2012, days before he was due to marry Noura, Syrian forces captured him in Damascus, accusing him of “harming state security”. After being interrogated and tortured, it took nine months for his case to be heard before a military court. Without legal representation, he was unable to in effect defend himself and was subsequently sent to Adra Prison.

“Bassel, I am very afraid,” wrote Noura in a public love letter, after marrying him while he was behind bars. “I am afraid about the country that is being slaughtered, divided, bleeding, being destroyed. I am very afraid that our dream is changing from seeing ourselves being the generation freeing their country to the one witnessing its destruction. Bassel, I am very afraid.”

In October 2015, Khartabil was transferred from Adra prison to an unknown military detention facility. His family and friends lost all contact and have no information regarding his current location. On 12 November 2015, Noura reported on her Facebook page rumours suggesting he had been sentenced to death.

“May God help him, we hope it’s not too late. We are worried sick about his life,” she wrote.

Khartabil is a member of the Wikipedia community, a true believer in free knowledge and freedom of expression. His arbitrary arrest, torture and rumoured death sentence are not only grave violations of International Human Rights Law, but also a significant blow to our shared values of internet freedom and free speech.

His life might be in immediate danger. We urgently call on the Syrian government to unconditionally release him without delay. Khartabil has never threatened the security of Syria. On the contrary, he promoted free knowledge throughout Syria and the Arab world, a non-violent voluntary act.

This Tuesday was the fourth anniversary of Khartabil’s detention. We will be marking it with protests on 19 March in London (Marble Arch, 2pm), Paris, Berlin and other cities throughout the world, calling for his immediate release, before it’s too late. Ask along with us: #WhereIsBassel?
