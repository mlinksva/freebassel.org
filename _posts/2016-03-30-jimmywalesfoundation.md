The #WhereIsBassel campaign has spread globally. On March 19, 2016,
marking the week of the 4th anniversary of Bassel’s arrest, people
from all over the world asked together: #WhereIsBassel? London,
Berlin, Paris, Toulouse, Sicily, Boston, San Francisco, Shenzen,
Singapore and Beirut – all called out for the Syrian government to
reveal Bassel’s whereabouts and send him free.
