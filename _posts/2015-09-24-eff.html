He worked with his global contacts in the information technology world, including EFF activists, to disseminate information to Syrian contacts on how to stay safer online.</p><p>Bassel had long been a key figure in the Syrian tech community. He co-founded <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120302070214/http://www.aikilab.org/">Aiki Lab</a>, a hackerspace in Damascus, led the Creative Commons Syria project, and regularly contributed code and content to Mozilla, Wikipedia, the Open Font Library, and the Open Clipart Library.</p><p>As the situation in Syria grew more unstable, Bassel saw more of his friends arrested. In March of 2012, his worldwide community of friends began to worry when Bassel's own online voice went silent. Unbeknown to his family and friends, on March 15, 2012, Bassel was <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/07/open-source-developer-bassel-khartabil-detained-syria">arrested</a> in the Mazzeh district of Damascus. It wasn’t until July 2012 that his supporters discovered—thanks to former detainees at Kfar Souseh—that he was being held at the General Intelligence Directorate there.</p><p style="text-align: center; color: #c6342a;"><a href="http://freebassel.org/" style="color: #c6342a;"><img src="/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_digital_voices/plugins/take_action/images/button.png" alt="Take Action" title="Take Action" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 10px;" class="eff_digital_voices-take_action"><strong>Join the #freebassel movement now</strong></a></p><p>In October 2012, Amnesty International confirmed that Bassel was being held at Kafr Souseh, relaying fears for his safety amidst local claims of torture. In response to this information, many groups and individuals called for Bassel’s immediate release and championed his case via <a href="http://freebassel.org/">FreeBassel.org</a>, a campaign run by a coalition of his friends and supporters.</p><p>Bassel was eventually charged in December 2012 with “spying for an enemy state.” As members of the European Parliament, Charles Tannock and Ana Gomes, noted in their 2013 address to the European Commission on behalf of Bassel, “it is strongly suspected that his arrest was part of an effort to restrict access to online communities and discourses and stifle free expression in Syria.” It was Bassel's visibility as a technologist and activist that made him a target for detention.</p><p>Freebassel.org <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/12/open-source-software-developer-bassel-khartabil-moved-syrian-military-prison">reported</a> that Bassel had been transferred to a Syrian military prison and had been denied a lawyer. Little was heard until Bassel’s family received a handwritten letter from prison, dated February 3, 2013. &nbsp;In it, Bassel referenced the efforts by the #FreeBassel campaign:</p><blockquote><p>Dear friends,<br> I can not find words to describe my feelings about everything you did for me.<br> What you did saved me and changed my situation to better.<br> Thank you all and big love!</p><p>3 February 2013</p><p>Bassel Khartabil Safadi</p></blockquote><p>The letter provided much-needed reassurance to Bassel’s friends, letting them know that he was safe and that the campaign had not caused harm.</p><p>On April 21, 2015 the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declared Bassel's detention <a href="http://en.alkarama.org/1763-syria-un-calls-for-the-release-of-freedom-of-speech-advocate-bassel-khartabil">a violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, and called for his release.</p><p>On May 20, 2015 Bassel spent his 34th birthday in Adra central prison—over 1100 days since he was first detained in Damascus. A determined advocate for an interconnected world, Bassel remains imprisoned and cut off from his family, friends, and international community. The <a href="http://freebassel.org/">Free Bassel campaign</a> continues to hold events all over the world to tell Bassel’s story, and—in the spirit of his ethos—create.</p>
