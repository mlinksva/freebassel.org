  quote: "In the middle east, the fight for freedom is generic: To stand for the right to create and share freely is to risk the most extreme response.

  quote: "Bassel has devoted his career to the rich culture of Syria and to protecting that culture. His contributions to the open Internet and open culture internationally, and his research and creativity, have benefitted all of us. Without people like Bassel, the Internet wouldn't be the vibrant and open resource that many of us take for granted."
